# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUser(-1);
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

I don't think this would run, only because we're invoking it with the value of -1. The code will technically 'run' but it will evaluate to an empty promise.

# Teacher Feedback

The function will run and it does evaluate...why might that be a problem?
