# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

async/await allows us to avoid a problem known as 'callback hell' commonly ran into by using .then and .catch. Since those methods require you to use a callback function we can find ourselves looking through massive chunks of functions nested in functions which can get confusing.
